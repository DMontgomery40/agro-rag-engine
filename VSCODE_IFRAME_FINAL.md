# VS Code Iframe - COMPLETE FIX ✅

**Date:** October 18, 2025, 11:18 PM MDT
**Status:** ALL ISSUES RESOLVED
**Verified:** Playwright tests (mandatory per CLAUDE.md)

---

## Summary

Fixed **6 critical issues** preventing VS Code iframe from working. All fixes verified with comprehensive Playwright tests.

---

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Health Check Returning HTTP 405
**Problem:** `requests.head()` returned 405 after redirect
**Fix:** Changed to `requests.get()` in `server/app.py:1902`
**Test:** Health check now returns `"readiness_stage": "ready"`

### ✅ 2. Navigation Never Called mount()
**Problem:** VS Code tab didn't initialize health checks
**Fix:** Added mount/unmount lifecycle in `gui/js/navigation.js:226-290`
**Test:** Health checks start when switching to VS Code tab

### ✅ 3. Embed Checkbox Unchecked by Default
**Problem:** Iframe hidden because checkbox unchecked
**Fix:** Added `checked` attribute in `gui/index.html:4582`
**Test:** Iframe container displays by default

### ✅ 4. Stale Mobile Navigation
**Problem:** Mobile nav had old "devtools" instead of "vscode"
**Fix:** Synced mobile nav with desktop in `gui/index.html:2241-2250`
**Test:** Navigation consistent across devices

### ✅ 5. Stale Playwright Test
**Problem:** Test looked for `#tab-devtools-editor`
**Fix:** Updated to `#tab-vscode` in `tests/editor_embed.spec.ts:10-11`
**Test:** Test matches current GUI structure

### ✅ 6. WebSocket 1006 Error (THE BIG ONE)
**Problem:** Reverse proxy couldn't handle WebSocket upgrades
**Root Cause:** FastAPI HTTP routes can't proxy WebSocket protocol
**Solution:** Direct connection (Option A)
**Fix:** Load iframe from direct URL in `gui/js/editor.js:52`
**Test:** VS Code workbench loads without errors

---

## The WebSocket Fix (Option A)

**Before:**
```javascript
iframe.src = '/editor/';  // Proxy - blocks WebSocket
```

**After:**
```javascript
iframe.src = data.url || '/editor/';  // Direct URL - WebSocket works!
```

**How it works:**
- Iframe loads from `http://127.0.0.1:4440` (direct to VS Code server)
- HTTP requests go straight to code-server
- WebSocket connections work natively (no proxy needed)
- No frame-blocking headers from code-server (it allows embedding)

**Why this is safe:**
- code-server runs with `--auth none` (local development)
- No X-Frame-Options or CSP blocking
- Same-origin policy doesn't apply (localhost)
- Production will need proper authentication

---

## Test Results

### All Tests Passing ✅
```bash
npx playwright test tests/gui/vscode-*.spec.ts --config=playwright.gui.config.ts

✓ vscode-iframe-full.spec.ts (1 test, 10.1s)
  - Iframe loads without errors
  - Container visible: true
  - Iframe visible: true
  - Health badge shows "Healthy"

✓ vscode-websocket.spec.ts (1 test, 16.8s)
  - Workbench visible: true
  - No WebSocket 1006 errors
  - No error dialogs
  - ✓ VS Code loaded successfully

Total: 2/2 passed
```

## Files Modified

1. **server/app.py** (line 1902)
   - Changed HEAD to GET for health check

2. **gui/js/navigation.js** (lines 226-290)
   - Added mount/unmount lifecycle calls

3. **gui/js/editor.js** (line 52)
   - Use direct URL instead of proxy for WebSocket support

4. **gui/index.html**
   - Line 2241-2250: Synced mobile nav
   - Line 4582: Added `checked` to embed checkbox

5. **tests/editor_embed.spec.ts** (lines 10-11)
   - Updated selectors for new structure

6. **tests/gui/vscode-iframe-full.spec.ts** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive iframe loading test

7. **tests/gui/vscode-websocket.spec.ts** (NEW)
   - WebSocket connection validation

8. **requirements.txt**
   - Added `websockets>=15.0` (for future proxy attempts)
   - Added `httpx-ws>=0.6` (for future proxy attempts)

---

## Production Considerations

**Current setup (development):**
- ✅ Works perfectly for local development
- ⚠️ No authentication on code-server
- ⚠️ Direct port exposure (4440)

**For production, consider:**
1. Enable code-server authentication (`--password` or `--cert`)
2. Add nginx/Caddy reverse proxy with WebSocket support
3. Use HTTPS/WSS for encrypted connections
4. Restrict port 4440 to localhost only
5. Consider containerizing the FastAPI server

---

## Verification Commands

Test the iframe:
```bash
# Full test suite
npx playwright test tests/gui/vscode-*.spec.ts --config=playwright.gui.config.ts

# Quick verification
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8012/health/editor | python3 -m json.tool
# Should show: "readiness_stage": "ready"
```

Manual test:
1. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8012/gui/
2. Click "VS Code" tab
3. Wait 2-3 seconds for health check
4. Iframe should load with VS Code
5. No error dialogs should appear
6. Workbench should be fully functional

---

## Cleanup Done

**Removed dead code:**
- Old devtools tab structure in mobile nav
- Stale test selectors

**Added:**
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Proper lifecycle management
- Direct WebSocket connectivity

**Documentation:**
- VSCODE_IFRAME_FIXES.md (detailed technical analysis)
- THIS FILE (final summary)

---

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

1. **Containerize FastAPI server** (architectural consistency)
2. **Add production reverse proxy** (nginx/Caddy for WebSocket)
3. **Implement authentication** (protect code-server in production)
4. **Add settings wizard persistence** (if setup wizard still appears)

**Status: COMPLETE ✅**
All mandatory Playwright verification done per CLAUDE.md requirements.
