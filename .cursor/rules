# Cursor AI Rules for AGRO RAG Engine

## Bug Documentation (MANDATORY)

**When you fix a bug that the user VERIFIES as fixed, you MUST document it in `agent_docs/bug-resolution.md`**

- This prevents repeat bugs across different agents and sessions
- ONLY add entries AFTER user confirms the fix works
- Include: symptoms, root cause, fix applied, files changed, prevention tips
- Follow the template in agent_docs/bug-resolution.md
- Many bugs are repeated by different agents - documentation prevents this

### Common Repeat Bugs to Watch For

- **Boolean .env values**: NEVER use `True`/`true`/`False`/`false` - always use `1` or `0`
- **Subtab navigation**: data-subtab names must match ID construction pattern
- **Absolute paths**: Never hardcode `/Users/...` paths, use relative or env vars
- Check `agent_docs/bug-resolution.md` for full list before starting work

## No Stubs or Placeholders

- NEVER add stubs, placeholders, or TODOs without explicit user approval
- Everything must be fully wired: backend to GUI, GUI to backend
- This is an ADA compliance and contractual requirement

## Verification Required

- GUI changes: Test with Playwright (put in `/tests`)
- Backend changes: Create smoke test (put in `/tests`)
- Never claim "done" without proof it works

## File Organization

- All agent-created .md files go in `/agent_docs/`
- Don't clutter root directory

## Git Workflow

- Never push to `main` directly
- Work on `development` branch
- Never commit without user approval
