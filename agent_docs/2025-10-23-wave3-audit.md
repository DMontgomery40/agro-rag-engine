# Wave 3 Outstanding Fix Audit (2025-10-23)

Reviewed the legacy Wave 3 checklist after recent stability fixes. Current status:

1. **Duplicate navigation scoping still missing**
   - `gui/index.html:2271-2290` renders both mobile and desktop tab bars without any `data-nav` scoping.
   - JS selectors (e.g., `querySelectorAll('[data-tab="dashboard"]')`) still hit both copies.
   - Impact: Playwright originally reported ambiguous targets; fix requires adding `data-nav` attributes (or hiding the mobile bar by default) and updating selectors accordingly.

2. **Infrastructure tab content still stale**
   - `gui/index.html:4490-4530` shows “Git Hooks (Auto-Index)” where “MCP Servers” should be.
   - The required “Paths & Endpoints” section is also absent; Infrastructure currently exposes only 4 of the 6 promised sections.
   - Action: restore the original MCP Servers and Paths & Endpoints panels from the old devtools tabs, wire them into the new layout.

3. **Console-error cleanup unverified**
   - No recent run of `tests/gui/wave3-smoke.spec.ts` to confirm the 404/ES6 errors are gone.
   - Need to audit `<script>` tags for missing assets and ensure any ES module scripts specify `type="module"`.

Next suggested steps:
1. Implement the navigation scoping (`data-nav="mobile"/"desktop"`) and adjust JS selectors.
2. Rebuild the Infrastructure tab sections using the archived content.
3. Re-run the Wave 3 smoke suite once the above are in place to validate all blockers.
