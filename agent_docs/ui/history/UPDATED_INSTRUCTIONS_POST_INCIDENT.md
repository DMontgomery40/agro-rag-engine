# Lead/Front Agent: Status Update (Post-Merge Incident)

**Your work is PERFECT** - no changes needed on your end!

---

## What Happened

- ‚úÖ You built React Dashboard in UI worktree (correct)
- ‚úÖ Committed to `feature/ui-migration` branch (correct)
- ‚ùå I attempted to merge both worktrees - **merge broke production**
- ‚úÖ Reverted - app is working again

**Not your fault** - merge strategy issue on my end.

---

## Your UI Work Status ‚úÖ

**Location**: `.worktrees/feature-ui-migration`

**What you built**:
- ‚úÖ Complete Vite/React/TS/Tailwind app in `web/`
- ‚úÖ Dashboard component fetches `/api/pipeline/summary`
- ‚úÖ Tailwind wired to CSS tokens
- ‚úÖ Built to `dist/` (ready for production)
- ‚úÖ Playwright test added
- ‚úÖ Modified `server/app.py` to mount `/web` (additive - doesn't break old code)

**Commit**: `72b7721` "feat: Add React Dashboard with Vite/TS/Tailwind"

---

## Docker Integration ‚úÖ

**Your code is Docker-ready**:
- ‚úÖ Vite build outputs to `web/dist/`
- ‚úÖ Server mounts `/web` using `common.paths` helpers
- ‚úÖ `docker-compose.services.yml` updated with `- ./web:/app/web` bind mount
- ‚úÖ When merged, Docker will serve your React app at `http://localhost:8012/web`

**No hardcoded paths** in your UI code - all API calls use relative `/api/*` paths.

---

## What's Next

### Option 1: Wait for Backend Fix, Then Re-Merge

**Backend agent will**:
1. Amend their commit to keep monolithic `app.py` unchanged
2. Only add `asgi.py`, `routers/`, `services/` (additive)
3. Re-commit

**Then I'll merge**:
1. Backend first (adds new code, doesn't touch old)
2. Your UI second (adds `web/` and mounts it)
3. Both `/gui` and `/web` coexist
4. Cutover later via env flag or separate commit

### Option 2: Cherry-Pick Just Your Changes

If backend fix takes time:
```bash
git checkout development
git cherry-pick 72b7721  # Just your UI commit
```

This adds React app without backend changes.

---

## Testing After Merge

**Once merged to development**:

### Manual Verify:
```bash
# Old GUI still works
curl http://localhost:8012/gui
# or browser: http://localhost:8012/

# New React app works
curl http://localhost:8012/web
# or browser: http://localhost:8012/web
```

### Playwright Test:
```bash
cd /Users/davidmontgomery/agro-rag-engine

# Make sure server running
docker ps | grep agro-api

# Run your test
npx playwright test tests/dashboard.spec.ts
```

**Expected**: Dashboard loads, shows Pipeline Summary with live data

---

## Docker Compose Workflow (For Your Reference)

**After any code changes to `server/` or `web/`**:

```bash
# Restart API container to pick up changes
docker compose -f docker-compose.services.yml restart api

# Or force recreate (if bind mounts added)
docker compose -f docker-compose.services.yml up -d --force-recreate api
```

**Why**: Bind mounts mean changes in local `/server` or `/web` directories immediately reflect in container at `/app/server` and `/app/web`. But uvicorn needs restart to reload Python code.

---

## Your Playwright Test (Docker-Aware)

**Current test**: Uses `http://localhost:8012/web`  
**Perfect** - this works for both:
- Local development (uvicorn running locally)
- Docker (container exposes port 8012)

**No changes needed** - test is environment-agnostic.

---

## Summary

**Your UI work is complete and Docker-ready**. Just waiting on backend merge fix, then we can integrate everything.

**No action required from you** - sit tight while I coordinate the corrected merge.

**Excellent work on the React scaffold!** The Dashboard component, TypeScript types, error handling, and Tailwind integration are all solid. üéâ
