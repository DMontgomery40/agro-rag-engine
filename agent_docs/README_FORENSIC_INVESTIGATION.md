## Verification Instructions

### Quick Verification (Browser)
```
1. Open GUI in browser (http://localhost:8012)
2. Click Chat tab
   - Should show chat interface with settings
   - Send message and look for feedback buttons
   - Check settings persist after refresh
3. Click Reranker > External Rerankers
   - Should show info panel with enabled/model/device
   - "Mine Triplets" button visible
   - Live terminal container present
4. Scroll to Cards section
   - Should show grid of cards (max 10)
   - "View All" button present
   - Terminal view available
5. Scroll to Grafana tab
   - Dashboard preview button visible
   - Open button functional
6. Check keywords in indexing settings
   - Exclude keywords input visible
```

### Git Verification
```bash
cd /Users/davidmontgomery/agro-rag-engine

# Verify all feature commits present
git log --oneline | grep -E "(Terminal|cards|feedback|Grafana)"

# Verify JS files exist
ls -l gui/js/{chat,reranker,cards,live-terminal,keywords,grafana}.js

# Verify index.html has containers
grep -c "cards-viewer\|reranker-terminal\|chat-settings" gui/index.html

# Show current status
git log -1 --oneline
git status
```

## Recovery Procedures (If Needed)

### Option 1: Current Code Works
```bash
# Just verify and test in browser
# No action needed
```

### Option 2: Restore from Latest Backup
```bash
cp gui/index.html.backup-before-tab-start-migration gui/index.html
git status  # Should show modification
# Test in browser
```

### Option 3: Restore Specific Commit
```bash
# Full GUI from 7b735ed (last good state before catastrophic overwrite)
git show 7b735ed:gui/index.html > gui/index.html
git show 7b735ed:gui/js/chat.js > gui/js/chat.js

# Or use specific feature commits
git show 306ee67:gui/js/live-terminal.js > gui/js/live-terminal.js
git show e35f5fb:gui/js/cards.js > gui/js/cards.js
git show 875db1c:gui/js/chat.js > gui/js/chat.js
```

### Option 4: Cherry-pick Missing Features
```bash
# If only specific features needed
git cherry-pick 306ee67  # Live terminal
git cherry-pick e35f5fb  # Cards display
git cherry-pick 875db1c  # Feedback buttons
```

## Recommendations

### Short Term (This Session)
1. Review the summary document
2. Verify features in browser
3. Test each feature's functionality
4. Confirm no regressions

### Medium Term (This Week)
1. Add Playwright tests for each feature
2. Create regression test suite
3. Tag stable release if features work
4. Update wiki documentation

### Long Term (Going Forward)
1. Set up pre-commit hooks to verify features
2. Add feature checklist to deployment workflow
3. Monitor for similar issues early
4. Maintain backup strategy
