# VS Code Iframe Issues - Implementation Summary

## Executive Summary
All three critical iframe issues have been comprehensively fixed with production-ready code, full backend support, and verified tests.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Race Condition - Iframe Loads Before Container Ready
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Iframe loaded as soon as port responded, even during service initialization, causing blank iframes and race conditions.

**Solution**: Enhanced health check with multi-stage readiness verification. Iframe only loads when `readiness_stage === 'ready'`.

**Files Changed**:
- `/server/app.py`: Enhanced `/health/editor` endpoint (lines 1865-1960)
- `/gui/js/editor.js`: Improved race condition handling (lines 1-92)

**Key Changes**:
```python
# Backend checks in order:
1. Basic HTTP connectivity (port responding)
2. Service readiness probe (HEAD request successful)
3. Startup delay check (service has been up > 2 seconds)
# Only returns ok=true when readiness_stage === 'ready'
```

```javascript
// Frontend only loads iframe when server confirms ready
if (data.readiness_stage === 'ready') {
    iframe.src = '/editor/';
}
```

---

### 2. Settings Persistence Broken
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Settings stored only in transient localStorage; lost on browser refresh or container restart.

**Solution**: Unified server-side persistent storage with client-side caching. Settings now survive all restarts.

**Files Changed**:
- `/server/app.py`: Added settings endpoints (lines 2054-2106)
- `/gui/js/editor-settings.js`: NEW unified settings module (128 lines)
- `/gui/js/vscode.js`: Refactored to compatibility layer (91 lines)
- `/gui/index.html`: Added script tag for editor-settings.js

**Key Changes**:
```python
# New backend endpoints:
GET  /api/editor/settings       → Read settings from out/editor/settings.json
POST /api/editor/settings       → Save settings to out/editor/settings.json
```

```javascript
// New module provides unified access:
EditorSettings.loadSettings()    → Load from server on startup
EditorSettings.saveSettings(update) → Sync to server
EditorSettings.getSettings()    → Access cached values
```

**Storage Location**: `out/editor/settings.json` (persists across restarts)

---

### 3. Setup Wizard Runs Every Time
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Onboarding completion only stored in browser localStorage; wizard ran on every fresh session.

**Solution**: Server-side completion tracking with persistent state file. Wizard skips if already completed.

**Files Changed**:
- `/server/app.py`: Added onboarding endpoints (lines 1994-2052)
- `/gui/js/onboarding.js`: Added server state checking (20 lines)

**Key Changes**:
```python
# New backend endpoints:
GET  /api/onboarding/state           → Read completion state
POST /api/onboarding/complete        → Mark wizard as complete
POST /api/onboarding/reset           → Reset for manual retrigger
```

```javascript
// New functions check server before showing wizard:
checkOnboardingCompletion()  → Returns if already completed
saveOnboardingCompletion()   → Saves completion to server
```

**Storage Location**: `out/onboarding/state.json` (persists across restarts)

## New Server Endpoints

### Onboarding State Management
```
GET /api/onboarding/state
    Response: {ok: bool, completed: bool, completed_at: str, step: int}

POST /api/onboarding/complete
    Response: {ok: bool, message: str}

POST /api/onboarding/reset
    Response: {ok: bool, message: str}
```

### Editor Settings Management
```
GET /api/editor/settings
    Response: {ok: bool, port: int, enabled: bool, host: str}

POST /api/editor/settings
    Body: {port?: int, enabled?: bool, host?: str}
    Response: {ok: bool, message: str}
```

### Enhanced Health Check
```
GET /health/editor
    Response: {
        ok: bool,
        enabled: bool,
        port: int,
        url: str,
        readiness_stage: 'startup_delay'|'timeout'|'connection_failed'|'ready'
    }
```

## Testing

### Backend Tests
**File**: `tests/test_iframe_fixes.py`

```bash
python tests/test_iframe_fixes.py
```

**Results**:
```
✓ test_onboarding_persistence: PASSED
✓ test_editor_settings_persistence: PASSED
✓ test_health_check_readiness: PASSED
✓ test_iframe_race_condition_fix: PASSED

Total: 4/4 tests passed
```

### Frontend Tests
**File**: `tests/editor_embed.spec.ts`

Added 3 new Playwright tests:
- `health check includes readiness stages`
- `settings persistence API available`
- `onboarding state persistence API available`

---

## Architecture

### New Persistent Storage
```
out/
├── editor/
│   ├── status.json (existing - container status)
│   ├── settings.json (NEW - persistent settings)
│   └── up.log
└── onboarding/
    └── state.json (NEW - completion tracking)
```

### Module Dependencies
```
Navigation Flow:
  rag-navigation.js → VSCode.showEditor() → editor.js → EditorSettings

Persistence:
  editor.js ↔ /api/editor/settings ↔ out/editor/settings.json
  onboarding.js ↔ /api/onboarding/* ↔ out/onboarding/state.json

Compatibility:
  vscode.js (shim) → delegates to editor.js
```

---

## Performance Impact

| Operation | Impact | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Page Load | +1 API call | Onboarding state check (cached) |
| Settings Save | +1 API call | Immediate persistence |
| Health Check | Same | Enhanced checks run same interval |
| Iframe Load | Improved | No more race conditions |

---

## Backward Compatibility

✅ All existing functionality preserved:
- Environment variables still respected
- localStorage fallback available
- Legacy navigation still works
- All existing endpoints functional

---

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- FastAPI server running
- Docker for container management

### Steps
1. Deploy backend changes (server/app.py)
2. Deploy frontend changes (gui/js files)
3. Update index.html to load new script
4. Restart server
5. Run smoke tests: `python tests/test_iframe_fixes.py`
6. Verify with Playwright: `npx playwright test tests/editor_embed.spec.ts`

### Verification
- Navigate to DevTools > Editor tab
- Check health badge shows ready
- Refresh browser - settings persist
- Check onboarding doesn't reappear
- Verify iframe loads smoothly without flicker

---

## Debugging Guide

### Check Health Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health/editor | jq .
```

### View Stored Settings
```bash
cat out/editor/settings.json
cat out/onboarding/state.json
```

### Browser Console
Look for these prefixes for detailed logs:
- `[Editor]` - Editor module logs
- `[EditorSettings]` - Settings module logs
- `[onboarding.js]` - Onboarding module logs
- `[VSCode]` - Compatibility layer logs

### Check API Response
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/editor/settings | jq .
curl http://localhost:8000/api/onboarding/state | jq .
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Settings UI**: Add GUI form in Misc tab to configure settings
2. **User Profiles**: Track settings per user/browser
3. **Migration**: Script to migrate old localStorage to server
4. **Audit Trail**: Log who changed settings and when
5. **Validation**: Stricter validation of settings values
