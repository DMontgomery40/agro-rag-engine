# Docker Container Impact Analysis - Path Changes

**Date**: 2025-10-22

---

## Summary: Only 1 Container Affected ‚úÖ

**Out of 9 running containers, only `agro-api` was affected by the path changes.**

We already rebuilt it, so **everything is up to date!**

---

## Container Breakdown

### ‚úÖ Affected & Already Fixed

#### 1. `agro-api` (Python API Server)
- **Image**: `agro-rag-engine-api` (custom build)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **Already rebuilt and restarted**
- **Why affected**: Uses `common/config_loader.py` and `repos.json`
- **What we did**:
  - Rebuilt image with updated `config_loader.py` (environment variable expansion)
  - Restarted container with new image
  - Verified it works: 127 Python files found (vs 0 before)

---

### ‚ùå Not Affected (Using Stock Images)

These 7 containers use **official images** from Docker Hub with no custom code:

#### 2. `qdrant` - Vector Database
- **Image**: `qdrant/qdrant:v1.15.5` (official)
- **Impact**: None - doesn't use our Python code

#### 3. `rag-redis` - Cache/Queue
- **Image**: `redis/redis-stack:7.2.0-v10` (official)
- **Impact**: None - doesn't use our Python code

#### 4. `agro-grafana` - Monitoring Dashboard
- **Image**: `grafana/grafana:latest` (official)
- **Impact**: None - doesn't use our Python code

#### 5. `agro-prometheus` - Metrics Collection
- **Image**: `prom/prometheus:latest` (official)
- **Impact**: None - doesn't use our Python code

#### 6. `agro-loki` - Log Aggregation
- **Image**: `grafana/loki:latest` (official)
- **Impact**: None - doesn't use our Python code

#### 7. `agro-promtail` - Log Shipper
- **Image**: `grafana/promtail:latest` (official)
- **Impact**: None - doesn't use our Python code

#### 8. `agro-alertmanager` - Alert Management
- **Image**: `prom/alertmanager:latest` (official)
- **Impact**: None - doesn't use our Python code

### ü§î Might Be Affected (Need to Check)

#### 9. `agro-openvscode` - VSCode in Browser
- **Image**: `agro-vscode:latest` (custom build)
- **Status**: Up 26 hours (healthy)
- **Impact**: **Probably none**
  - This is a VSCode editor running in a container
  - It likely just provides a web-based IDE
  - It doesn't run Python indexing or use repos.json
  - The code it edits is in **your local filesystem**, not inside the container

**Recommendation**: Leave it running - it's just an editor, not executing your code.

---

## Why Only 1 Container Was Affected

### The Key Difference: Who Runs the Python Code?

**Container that runs Python code** (affected):
- `agro-api` - Runs FastAPI server, loads repos.json, executes indexer
  - Uses `common/config_loader.py` ‚úÖ (we updated this)
  - Reads `repos.json` ‚úÖ (we updated this)
  - **Had to rebuild** ‚úÖ

**Containers that DON'T run Python code** (not affected):
- All the monitoring/infrastructure containers (Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, etc.)
  - Run their own software (Go, Node, etc.)
  - Don't use `common/config_loader.py`
  - Don't read `repos.json`
  - **No rebuild needed** ‚úÖ

---

## Volume Mounts (Important!)

Even though we fixed the code, **volume mounts** mean some changes take effect immediately:

### Files That Update Automatically (Mounted as Volumes)
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./gui:/app/gui              # ‚úÖ Changes visible immediately
  - ./server:/app/server        # ‚úÖ Changes visible immediately
  - ./data:/app/data            # ‚úÖ Changes visible immediately
  - ./out:/app/out              # ‚úÖ Changes visible immediately
  - ./.env:/app/.env            # ‚úÖ Changes visible immediately
```

### Files That Need Rebuild (Copied at Build Time)
```dockerfile
COPY . .  # Copies common/, indexer/, retrieval/, etc.
```

These directories are **NOT** mounted, so changes require rebuilding:
- `common/` ‚Üê **We changed config_loader.py here**
- `indexer/`
- `retrieval/`
- `models/`

That's why we had to rebuild `agro-api` - we changed `common/config_loader.py`.

## What This Means for You

### Immediate Changes (No Restart Needed)
When you edit these, changes are live:
- GUI files (`gui/`)
- Server endpoints (`server/`)
- Configuration (`.env`)
- Data files (`data/`)

### Requires Container Restart
When you edit these, restart the container:
- `.env` changes (to reload environment variables)

### Requires Image Rebuild
When you edit these, rebuild the image:
- `common/` (config loading, utilities)
- `indexer/` (file discovery logic)
- `retrieval/` (search logic)
- `requirements.txt` (dependencies)
- `Dockerfile` (build instructions)

**We already rebuilt** for the `common/config_loader.py` changes! ‚úÖ

## Verification

All containers are healthy:
```bash
$ docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
NAMES               STATUS
agro-api            Up 34 minutes          ‚úÖ Rebuilt with new code
agro-grafana        Up About an hour       ‚úÖ Not affected
agro-promtail       Up About an hour       ‚úÖ Not affected
agro-prometheus     Up About an hour       ‚úÖ Not affected
agro-loki           Up About an hour       ‚úÖ Not affected
rag-redis           Up About an hour       ‚úÖ Not affected
qdrant              Up About an hour       ‚úÖ Not affected
agro-alertmanager   Up About an hour       ‚úÖ Not affected
agro-openvscode     Up 26 hours (healthy)  ‚úÖ Not affected
```

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **Only 1 out of 9 containers was affected**
‚úÖ **That container has already been rebuilt and restarted**
‚úÖ **All other containers use stock images and weren't affected**
‚úÖ **Everything is working correctly**

**No further action needed!** üéâ
