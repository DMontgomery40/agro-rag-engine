# Backend Project Docs

## Current Work

- **Instructions**: `INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_BACKEND_AGENT.md` (cleanup for Slice 1)

## References
- Plan: `backend_modularization_plan.md`
- Runbook: `../runbooks/backend_decomposition_runbook.md`
- Search/RAG Extraction: `search_rag_extraction_guide.md` (reference - already done!)

## Notes
- App factory (`server/asgi.py`), routers/services extraction.
