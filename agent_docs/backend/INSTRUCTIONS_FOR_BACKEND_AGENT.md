# Instructions for Backend Agent: Final Cleanup for Slice 1

**Current Status**: Extraction EXCEEDS expectations! Just need minor cleanup.

---

## What You've Accomplished ‚úÖ

**Outstanding work!** You've extracted far more than initially planned:

### Routers Extracted
- ‚úÖ `server/routers/config.py` - `/api/config-schema`
- ‚úÖ `server/routers/pipeline.py` - `/api/pipeline/summary`
- ‚úÖ `server/routers/traces.py` - `/api/traces*`
- ‚úÖ `server/routers/repos.py` - `/api/repos*`
- ‚úÖ `server/routers/editor.py` - editor endpoints
- ‚úÖ `server/routers/search.py` - `/search`, `/answer`, `/api/chat` **[BONUS!]**

### Services Created
- ‚úÖ `server/services/config_store.py` - atomic writes, secrets
- ‚úÖ `server/services/traces.py` - trace management
- ‚úÖ `server/services/editor.py` - lifecycle management
- ‚úÖ `server/services/rag.py` - search/answer/chat with LangGraph **[BONUS!]**
- ‚úÖ `server/services/keywords.py` - keyword generation **[BONUS!]**

### Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ App factory with request ID middleware
- ‚úÖ Global JSON error handler
- ‚úÖ Logging standard documented
- ‚úÖ Tests green for all extracted routers

**You've completed Slice 1 AND Slice 2 backend work!**

## Minor Cleanup Needed (Before Merge)

### Issue 1: Duplicate `config_router` Include

**File**: `.worktrees/feature-backend-modularization/server/asgi.py`

**Problem**: `config_router` is included twice:
- Line 106: `app.include_router(config_router)` ‚úÖ First (correct)
- Line 216: `app.include_router(config_router)` ‚ùå Duplicate

**Fix**: Delete line 216 (or the second occurrence)

```python
# Around line 210-220 in asgi.py
app.include_router(feedback_router)
app.include_router(reranker_info_router)
app.include_router(alerts_router)
app.include_router(monitoring_router)
app.include_router(traces_router)
app.include_router(repos_router)
app.include_router(config_router)  # ‚ùå DELETE THIS LINE (duplicate)
app.include_router(editor_router)
```

### Issue 2: Inline `/api/pipeline/summary` Still in `asgi.py`

**File**: `.worktrees/feature-backend-modularization/server/asgi.py`

**Problem**: `/api/pipeline/summary` is defined in TWO places:
1. `server/routers/pipeline.py` (extracted router) ‚úÖ
2. Lines 112-207 in `asgi.py` (inline definition) ‚ùå

**Decision needed**: Which one to keep?

**Option A (Recommended)**: Keep router, remove inline
- Router is cleaner separation of concerns
- Inline was probably leftover from initial implementation

**Option B**: Keep inline, remove router include
- If inline version has specific logic needed in app factory

**Recommended Fix** (Option A):
```python
# In asgi.py, DELETE lines 112-207 (entire inline function)
# Keep the router include at line 107:
app.include_router(pipeline_router)
```

### Cleanup Steps

```bash
cd .worktrees/feature-backend-modularization

# 1. Edit server/asgi.py
#    - Remove duplicate config_router include (line 216)
#    - Remove inline pipeline_summary function (lines 112-207)

# 2. Verify tests still pass
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/test_pipeline_summary_direct.py
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/test_config_schema_direct.py
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/test_request_id_header.py
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q tests/routers/test_*.py

# 3. Verify no import errors
python -c "from server.app import app; print('‚úÖ App imports successfully')"

# 4. Quick smoke test (optional)
python -m uvicorn server.app:app --reload --port 8012
# In another terminal:
curl http://localhost:8012/api/pipeline/summary
curl http://localhost:8012/api/config-schema
```

## After Cleanup: Ready to Merge!

Once cleanup is complete, you're **100% done with Slice 1** (and bonus Slice 2 backend work).

### What to Report Back

1. ‚úÖ Duplicate router includes removed
2. ‚úÖ Inline function removed (or clarify if keeping it intentionally)
3. ‚úÖ All tests green (pytest output)
4. ‚úÖ No import errors
5. üöÄ **Ready to merge to development**

---

## Merge Checklist

Before merge:
- ‚úÖ All routers extracted and wired
- ‚úÖ All services created
- ‚úÖ No duplicate route definitions
- ‚úÖ No duplicate router includes
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ No absolute paths in new code
- ‚úÖ Logging uses `logger.info()` with context
- ‚úÖ Request IDs on all responses
- ‚úÖ JSON error handling for 500s

---

## Next Phase (After Merge to Development)

### Slice 3: Keywords Endpoints (Already Extracted!)

You've already extracted keywords service and likely have it wired. If not:

**Create**: `server/routers/keywords.py`
**Extract**:
- `GET /api/keywords`
- `POST /api/keywords/add`
- `POST /api/keywords/generate`

**Service**: `server/services/keywords.py` (already exists!)

### Slice 4: Indexing Endpoints

**Create**: `server/routers/indexing.py`
**Extract**:
- `POST /api/index/start`
- `POST /api/index/run`
- `GET /api/index/status`
- `GET /api/index/stats`

**Create**: `server/services/indexing.py`

### Slice 5: Remaining Endpoints

- Cost estimator (`/api/cost/*`)
- Profiles (`/api/profiles/*`)
- MCP (`/api/mcp/*`)
- Onboarding (`/api/onboarding/*`)
- Semantic Boosts (`/api/cards/*`)

## Notes

### About the Search/RAG Extraction

You've successfully extracted the most complex endpoints (search/answer/chat) with LangGraph integration. The implementation looks solid:
- ‚úÖ Lazy-loading LangGraph graph
- ‚úÖ Fallback to retrieval-only when generation unavailable
- ‚úÖ Env override scoping for chat
- ‚úÖ Metrics integration
- ‚úÖ Error handling

**Great work managing the complexity!**

### About the Service Layer

Your service functions follow good patterns:
- Clear separation of concerns
- No HTTP-specific logic (that's in routers)
- Reusable across different router endpoints
- Error handling with logging

**This is exactly the right architecture.**

---

## Questions?

**Q: Should I add more tests?**
A: Current direct-import tests are sufficient for merge. Integration tests can come later.

**Q: Should I refactor the RAG service more?**
A: No - extraction is complete. Leave optimization for later.

**Q: What about the massive `app.py` in main branch?**
A: That's fine - it stays in main branch. After merge, it becomes the legacy version. We don't delete it until all routers are extracted and tested in production.

---

**You're essentially done!** Just clean up the two duplicates and you're ready to merge. Excellent work extracting way more than initially scoped! üéâ
