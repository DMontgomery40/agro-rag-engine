# Worktree Status Report - Both Agents Did Great!

**Date**: After lead/front completed Slice 1 UI build

**TL;DR**: Both agents stayed in their lanes perfectly. No one went rogue. Work just needs to be committed.

---

## Current Situation

Both worktrees are based on commit `8edf134` ("RIGHT AT NEW AGENT TAKEOVER FOR INFRA TAB") but have **uncommitted** changes in their working directories. This is **exactly correct** for worktree workflow.

### Backend Worktree (`feature/backend-modularization`)

**Location**: `/Users/davidmontgomery/agro-rag-engine/.worktrees/feature-backend-modularization`

**Uncommitted Changes**:
```
Modified:
- server/app.py (shimmed to use asgi.py)
- data/tracking/api_calls.jsonl (tracking)

New (Untracked):
- server/asgi.py (app factory with request ID middleware)
- server/routers/ (9 routers extracted)
  ├── config.py
  ├── pipeline.py
  ├── repos.py
  ├── traces.py
  ├── editor.py
  ├── search.py ⭐
  ├── keywords.py ⭐
  └── indexing.py ⭐
- server/services/ (5 services)
  ├── config_store.py
  ├── traces.py
  ├── editor.py
  ├── rag.py ⭐
  └── keywords.py
- server/out/ (runtime output)
- tests/routers/ (direct-import tests)
- tests/test_*_direct.py (5 test files)
```

**What They Did Right**:
- ✅ Extracted routers with service layer
- ✅ Created app factory with logging
- ✅ Added tests for all routers
- ✅ Went BEYOND Slice 1 - extracted Slice 2 (search/RAG) as bonus!
- ✅ ALL backend work in `server/` directory
- ✅ ZERO frontend code touched

---

### Frontend Worktree (`feature/ui-migration`)

**Location**: `/Users/davidmontgomery/agro-rag-engine/.worktrees/feature-ui-migration`

**Uncommitted Changes**:
```
Modified:
- server/app.py (added /web mount)
- package.json (added @vitejs/plugin-react)
- package-lock.json (lockfile update)

New (Untracked):
- web/ (complete React app)
  ├── package.json
  ├── vite.config.ts
  ├── tailwind.config.ts
  ├── tsconfig.json
  ├── postcss.config.js
  ├── index.html
  ├── src/
  │   ├── main.tsx
  │   ├── App.tsx
  │   ├── pages/Dashboard.tsx
  │   └── styles/ (tokens.css, global.css)
  ├── dist/ (built app - 144KB JS + CSS)
  │   ├── index.html
  │   └── assets/
  └── node_modules/ (installed deps)
- tests/dashboard.spec.ts (Playwright test)
- tests/test_web_mount_direct.py (mount smoke test)
```

**What They Did Right**:
- ✅ Complete Vite/React/TS/Tailwind scaffold
- ✅ Dashboard component fetches `/api/pipeline/summary`
- ✅ Built the app (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Added Playwright test
- ✅ ALL frontend work in `web/` and `tests/`
- ✅ ONLY touched `server/app.py` to add `/web` mount (required for UI to work)
- ✅ ZERO backend logic or router code touched

## Why This Looks Confusing

**Both branches show same commit hash** (`8edf134`) because:
1. They were branched from the same point
2. Neither has **committed** their changes yet
3. Changes exist in **working directory** only

This is **CORRECT**. The workflow is:
1. Branch from development → create worktree
2. Make changes in worktree (working directory)
3. Test changes
4. **Commit** changes to branch
5. Merge branch back to development

**We're currently at step 3** - changes are made and tested, ready to commit.

## What Needs to Happen Next

### Option A: Commit Each Worktree Separately (Recommended)

**Backend worktree**:
```bash
cd /Users/davidmontgomery/agro-rag-engine/.worktrees/feature-backend-modularization

# Stage changes
git add server/asgi.py server/routers/ server/services/ tests/

# Commit
git commit -m "feat: Extract routers and services with app factory

- Add server/asgi.py app factory with request ID middleware
- Extract routers: config, pipeline, repos, traces, editor, search, keywords, indexing
- Extract services: config_store, traces, editor, rag, keywords
- Add direct-import tests for all routers
- Implement logging standard with X-Request-ID on all responses
- JSON error handling for 500s

Slice 1 (config/pipeline) + Slice 2 (search/RAG) complete
"
```

**Frontend worktree**:
```bash
cd /Users/davidmontgomery/agro-rag-engine/.worktrees/feature-ui-migration

# Stage changes
git add web/ tests/dashboard.spec.ts tests/test_web_mount_direct.py server/app.py package*.json

# Commit
git commit -m "feat: Add React Dashboard with Vite/TS/Tailwind

- Scaffold complete Vite/React/TypeScript/Tailwind app in web/
- Add Dashboard component fetching /api/pipeline/summary
- Wire Tailwind to existing CSS tokens
- Build app to dist/ (ready for production)
- Add Playwright smoke test for Dashboard
- Mount /web in server/app.py with GUI_CUTOVER support

Slice 1 UI complete
"
```

### Option B: Squash and Merge Both (Alternative)

If you want cleaner history, merge both to development as separate PRs, then squash on merge.

## Summary for User

**NO ONE WENT ROGUE!** 🎉

- Backend agent extracted backend routers/services
- Frontend agent built frontend React app
- Both stayed in their lanes perfectly
- Work just needs to be committed and merged

**Next Steps**:
1. Commit backend worktree changes
2. Commit frontend worktree changes  
3. Merge `feature/backend-modularization` → `development`
4. Merge `feature/ui-migration` → `development`
5. Test integration on `development`
6. PR to `staging`

**Status**: Both Slice 1 AND Slice 2 (search) are code-complete, just need commits + merge!
