# CRITICAL: Merge Issue - Resolved

**What Happened**: Attempted to merge backend refactor but accidentally replaced monolithic `app.py` (4165 lines) with shim (4 lines), breaking production.

**Status**: ✅ REVERTED - app is working again

---

## Timeline

1. ✅ Backend worktree committed router/service extraction
2. ✅ UI worktree committed React dashboard
3. ✅ Fixed docker-compose.services.yml to add `/web` mount
4. ❌ Merged both to development - **MISTAKE**: backend had shimmed app.py
5. ❌ Docker restart picked up 4-line app.py, all endpoints returned 404
6. ✅ Reverted with `git reset --hard HEAD~2`
7. ✅ Docker restarted, app working again

**Current state**: Development branch at commit `9d0c918` (before merges)

---

## Root Cause

**Backend agent's strategy was CORRECT** (additive):
- Created `asgi.py` (app factory)
- Created `routers/` and `services/`
- **Modified** `app.py` to be a shim

**Problem**: The modification to `app.py` should have been DELAYED until cutover, not included in the extraction commit.

**Correct approach**: Extract routers/services WITHOUT touching `app.py` yet.

---

## Corrected Strategy

### The Plan (Strangler Pattern Done Right):

**Phase 1 - Add New Code** (what we SHOULD do):
```
server/
  app.py (4165 lines - UNCHANGED, still serving production)
  asgi.py (NEW - app factory)
  routers/ (NEW - extracted endpoints)
  services/ (NEW - business logic)
```

Both versions coexist. Production uses `app.py`, tests verify `asgi.py` works.

**Phase 2 - Test New Code**:
- Run tests against BOTH versions
- Optionally run new version on different port
- Verify parity

**Phase 3 - Cutover**:
- Replace `app.py` with shim **in a separate commit**
- Update Dockerfile if needed
- Keep `app_legacy.py` backup for rollback

## How to Fix the Worktree Commits

### Backend Worktree Fix:

```bash
cd .worktrees/feature-backend-modularization

# Check current status
git log --oneline -2
# Should show: fb41272 feat: Extract routers and services...

# Reset to before that commit
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Restore monolithic app.py
git checkout HEAD -- server/app.py

# Now server/app.py is back to 4165 lines (monolithic)
# BUT routers/, services/, asgi.py are still staged

# Commit again without app.py changes
git commit -m "feat: Add modular routers/services (parallel to monolithic app)

- NEW: server/asgi.py app factory with request ID middleware
- NEW: server/routers/* (9 routers extracted)
- NEW: server/services/* (5 services)
- KEEP: server/app.py unchanged (monolithic version still active)
- Tests verify both old (app.py) and new (asgi.py) code paths

Additive refactor - both versions coexist for safe migration
Slice 1 + Slice 2 backend ready for parallel testing
"
```

### UI Worktree:
**No changes needed** - UI worktree is fine as-is

---

## Merge Sequence (Corrected)

```bash
# 1. Merge backend (now safe - doesn't touch app.py)
git checkout development
git merge --no-ff feature/backend-modularization

# 2. Merge UI
git merge --no-ff feature/ui-migration

# 3. Build web app
cd web && npm install && npm run build

# 4. Test
curl http://localhost:8012/health  # Old app works
curl http://localhost:8012/gui     # Old GUI works
curl http://localhost:8012/web     # New React app works (if served)

# 5. Test new modular code via Python
python3 -c "from server.asgi import create_app; ..."  # Should work
```

---

## Docker Integration (Still Valid)

The docker-compose.services.yml changes are CORRECT:
- ✅ Added `- ./web:/app/web` volume mount
- ✅ Existing bind mounts unchanged

After merge, Docker will see:
- `/app/server/app.py` - monolithic (working)
- `/app/server/asgi.py` - modular (available but not active)
- `/app/server/routers/` - NEW
- `/app/server/services/` - NEW
- `/app/web/` - React app

**Cutover later**: Change Dockerfile CMD or add env switch

---

## Status

- ✅ Original app restored and working
- ✅ Docker web mount added
- ❌ Merges reverted (need to redo with corrected strategy)
- ⏳ Backend worktree needs commit amendment (restore app.py)

---

## Next Steps

1. **YOU DECIDE**: Should I fix the backend worktree commit and re-merge? Or different approach?
2. After merge: Test both old and new code paths work
3. Cutover to modular version in separate PR (later)

**Apologies for the disruption**. The refactor plan was solid, I just executed the merge wrong.
