# Status: Ready for Slices 2 & 3

**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ GREEN - Production stable, both agents ready to proceed in parallel

---

## Executive Summary

âœ… **Merges complete** - Both backend and frontend work merged to `development`  
âœ… **Pushed to origin** - Remote branch updated  
âœ… **Production stable** - All endpoints working, Docker healthy  
âœ… **Architecture validated** - Parallel/additive refactor working correctly  
âœ… **Next slices assigned** - Both agents have clear tasks

---

## What Changed in Development Branch

**Backend** (Slice 1 & 2 - Complete):
- Added `server/asgi.py` (app factory)
- Added 9 routers: config, pipeline, repos, traces, editor, search, keywords, indexing
- Added 5 services: config_store, traces, editor, rag, keywords
- Added comprehensive tests
- **Monolithic app.py UNCHANGED** (parallel architecture)

**Frontend** (Slice 1 - Complete):
- Added `web/` - Complete Vite/React/TS/Tailwind scaffold
- Dashboard component fetches `/api/pipeline/summary`
- Built to `web/dist/` (production ready)
- Playwright test added

**Infrastructure**:
- `docker-compose.services.yml` - Added `/web` bind mount
- Both `/gui` and `/web` now mounted in Docker

## Production Verification (All Green)

```
âœ… Health: http://localhost:8012/health â†’ 200
âœ… Config: http://localhost:8012/api/config â†’ 200  
âœ… Search: http://localhost:8012/search?q=test â†’ 200
âœ… Legacy GUI: http://localhost:8012/gui â†’ 200
âœ… React UI: http://localhost:8012/web â†’ 200 (Dashboard renders)
âœ… Docker: 9 containers running
âœ… New routers: Import via server.asgi works
```

## Active Assignments

### Backend Agent: Slice 3 - Cost & Profiles
**File**: `agent_docs/backend/ASSIGNMENT_ACTIVE.md`  
**Endpoints**: `/api/cost/*`, `/api/profiles/*`  
**Time**: 3-4 hours  
**Pattern**: Same as Slices 1 & 2 (routers + services, don't touch app.py)

### Frontend Agent: Slice 2 - Config UI
**File**: `agent_docs/ui/ASSIGNMENT_ACTIVE.md`  
**Feature**: Schema-driven settings form  
**APIs**: `/api/config-schema`, `/api/config`  
**Time**: 4-5 hours  
**Pattern**: Same as Dashboard (fetch + render, Playwright test)

### Working Mode: **PARALLEL** âœ…
Both agents can work simultaneously - no conflicts expected.

## Architecture Decisions Made (By Opus)

**Merge Strategy**: **Parallel/Additive** (Option A)
- Old monolithic code stays in production
- New modular code exists alongside for testing
- Cutover later via separate commit

**Docker Integration**: **Verified Working**
- All paths use `common.paths` helpers
- Bind mounts configured correctly
- Both old and new code accessible in containers

**Testing Approach**: **Dual Path**
- Old code: Production endpoints via `server.app:app`
- New code: Test via `server.asgi:create_app()`
- Frontend: Playwright against running Docker

---

## Key Documents for Reference

**For both agents**:
- `agent_docs/shared/DELEGATION_INSTRUCTIONS_2025_10_24.md` - Opus's full strategy
- `agent_docs/feature_inventory_and_mapping.md` - All features mapped

**Backend specific**:
- `agent_docs/backend/SLICE_3_ASSIGNMENT.md` - Current task details
- `agent_docs/backend_modularization_plan.md` - Overall strategy

**Frontend specific**:
- `agent_docs/ui/SLICE_2_ASSIGNMENT.md` - Current task details  
- `agent_docs/ui_migration_to_vite_react_ts_tailwind.md` - Overall strategy
- `agent_docs/ui/design_tokens.md` - Tailwind/CSS integration

---

## Coordination Protocol

### Daily Sync (Via Me):
- Backend reports: Files created, tests passing
- Frontend reports: Components built, Playwright green
- I verify: No API contract conflicts, Docker compatibility

### Integration Points:
- Frontend uses backend APIs (schema, config, pipeline)
- Both respect Docker bind mount structure
- Tests don't interfere (backend = pytest, frontend = Playwright)

### Escalation:
- Architectural questions â†’ Opus architect
- Blockers â†’ User (David)
- Merge approval â†’ User

## Success Metrics (Slices 2 & 3)

**Backend Slice 3 complete when**:
- âœ… Cost + profiles routers extracted
- âœ… Tests green
- âœ… Wired into asgi.py
- âœ… Docker verified

**Frontend Slice 2 complete when**:
- âœ… Config page renders from schema
- âœ… Settings save via API
- âœ… Playwright test passes
- âœ… Built to dist/

## Current Branch State

```
development (HEAD: 7c0109e)
â”œâ”€â”€ Merged: feature/backend-modularization
â”œâ”€â”€ Merged: feature/ui-migration
â””â”€â”€ Pushed to: origin/development âœ…
```

**Both agents**: Work on `development` or create new feature branches as preferred

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

**Production unaffected** - monolithic app.py still runs. If issues arise:

```bash
# Quick fix: Just restart Docker
docker compose -f docker-compose.services.yml restart api

# Nuclear option: Revert merges
git revert 7c0109e 9ecd5be  # Revert both merges
git push origin development
```

But shouldn't be needed - architecture is sound.

**Agents: You're cleared to start!** Report progress as you go. ðŸŽ¯
