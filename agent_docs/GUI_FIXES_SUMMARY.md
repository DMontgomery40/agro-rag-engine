## What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Chat Settings Black Screen ✅
**Severity**: HIGH | **Status**: FIXED

**Problem**:
- Clicking "Settings" subtab in Chat tab showed completely black/empty content
- No text or form elements visible
- Interface subtab worked correctly

**Root Cause**:
- Missing closing `</div>` tag for `#tab-chat-ui` container
- Caused `#tab-chat-settings` to be nested at wrong DOM depth (5 instead of 4)
- CSS selectors couldn't properly target the element

**Fix Applied** (gui/index.html:5438):
```html
Added closing </div> after chat interface content:
+                </div>  <!-- This line was missing -->
```

**Result**:
- DOM structure now correct
- Both subtabs now siblings at same depth
- Settings form will render properly

### Issue 2: Mobile Navigation Drawer ✅
**Severity**: HIGH | **Status**: FIXED

**Problem**:
- Hamburger menu button (☰) visible in mobile (390x844)
- Button clicks appeared to register (active state showed)
- Navigation drawer never appeared on screen
- Mobile navigation completely inaccessible

**Root Cause**:
- CSS rule `display: none` on `.mobile-nav-drawer` hid the element completely
- JavaScript couldn't show the drawer because CSS was overriding it
- Comment indicated it was disabled due to "layout issues"

**Fix Applied** (gui/index.html:1271):
```css
Removed: display: none; /* HIDDEN - causes layout issues, use .tab-bar instead */

Drawer now uses:
- position: fixed
- left: -100% (off-screen initially)
- JavaScript can animate left: 0 to slide in
```

**Result**:
- Drawer element now visible to JavaScript
- Hamburger button can now control drawer visibility
- Smooth slide animation works as designed

### Issue 3: Mobile Sidebar Visibility ✅
**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Status**: FIXED

**Problem**:
- Right sidebar (Cost Calculator, Profiles, etc.) still visible in mobile
- Sidebar created horizontal scrollbar in mobile viewport
- Should be completely hidden in mobile mode

**Root Cause**:
- Mobile CSS media query didn't properly hide `.sidepanel`
- Previous styling tried to "stack below" with grid-column and max-height
- Sidebar remained visible, consuming horizontal space

**Fix Applied** (gui/index.html:1106-1107):
```css
Before:
    .sidepanel {
        grid-column: 1;
        border-top: 1px solid var(--line);
        max-height: 60vh;
    }

After:
    .sidepanel {
        display: none;
    }
```

**Result**:
- Sidebar completely hidden in mobile viewport
- No horizontal scrollbar
- Mobile layout truly single-column

### Issue 4: Chat Subtab Attribute Mismatch ✅
**Severity**: MEDIUM | **Status**: FIXED

**Problem**:
- Chat Settings subtab button and navigation.js were looking for different attribute values
- Button had `data-subtab="chat-settings"` but JavaScript expected something different
- Caused subtab selection logic to fail

**Root Cause**:
- Button HTML and JavaScript selector were out of sync
- Inconsistent naming convention (full "chat-ui" vs shorter "ui" form)

**Fix Applied**:

**Part 1** (gui/index.html:2288-2289):
```html
Before:
<button data-subtab="chat-ui" ...>Interface</button>
<button data-subtab="chat-settings" ...>Settings</button>

After:
<button data-subtab="ui" ...>Interface</button>
<button data-subtab="settings" ...>Settings</button>
```

**Part 2** (gui/js/navigation.js:359):
```javascript
Before:
$(`${showBarSel} button[data-subtab="chat-ui"]`)?.classList.add('active');

After:
$(`${showBarSel} button[data-subtab="ui"]`)?.classList.add('active');
```

**Result**:
- HTML and JavaScript now synchronized
- Chat subtab selection works correctly
- Settings button properly highlights when selected
- Consistent with other subtab naming patterns
