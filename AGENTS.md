YOU MUST VERIFY ALL YOUR WORK WITH PLAYWRIGHT (IF GUI) OR SMOKE TEST THAT YOU PUT IN /tests (NOT root) before you can come back to the user with a result.  This is non-negotiable 

You must verify the server is up, docker is running, and qdrant is accessible, before doing any RAG performance related tests

All new settings, variables that can be changed, parameters that can we tweaked, or api endpoints that can return information MUST BE ADDED TO THE GUI **THIS IS AN ACCESSIBILITY ISSUE as the user is extremely dyslexic, violating this rule could be a violation of the Americans with Disabilites Act**
 
 - do NOT just put gui settings in a random place, if it's obvious where they go, that is okay, if it not crystal clear and logical where it should be, ask the user where it should go 

Do not add features or code that the user didn't ask for, even if you think it's helpful of common sense to do, ASK THE USER FIRST 2
